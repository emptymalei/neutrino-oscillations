In certain regions inside a star or a supernova where convection is prominent, the matter density varies rapidly as a function of distance [^Muller2015] [^Couch2015]. The neutrino flavor evolution in such environments is qualitatively different than that with a smooth density profile [^Krastev1989] [^Loreti1994] [^Akhmedov2000] [^Friedland2006] [^Kneller2010] [^Kneller2013] [^Patton2014]. For example, the flavor conversion of the neutrino is greatly enhanced if the matter density fluctuates with certain wavenumbers. This is known as the parametric resonance [^Krastev1989] [^Akhmedov1999].

In this chapter, I will explain the parametric resonance from the perspective of Rabi oscillations. I will first review the Rabi oscillation phenomenon and derive a criterion when the off-resonance Rabi mode may have a significant impact on the resonance behavior. I will then introduce the background matter basis with which the equation of motion simplifies. After demonstrating the simplest example of the parametric resonance in the presence of a sinusoidal matter profile with the Rabi formula, I will explain the interference effect when there exist multiple Fourier modes in the matter profile. Finally, I will show how to use the Jacobi-Anger expansion to decompose an arbitrary matter profile into an infinite sum of Rabi modes. This decomposition is similar to what J. Kneller et al. did in reference [^Kneller2013] [^Patton2014] but is achieved in a way that makes the physics much more transparent. I will also use the criterion that I have derived for the interference between two Rabi modes to show that only a finite number of Rabi modes are relevant in a real physical system.
