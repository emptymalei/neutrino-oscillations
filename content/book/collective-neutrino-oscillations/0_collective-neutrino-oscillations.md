Neutrino oscillations in a matter background have well-defined linear dynamics as I  have discussed in the preceding chapters. In this chapter, I will discuss neutrino oscillations in a dense neutrino medium where the equation of motion becomes nonlinear.
One of such examples is the (core-collapse) supernova explosion which releases approximately $10^{58}$ neutrinos within seconds [^Bahcall1987]. The neutrino density inside a supernova can be so large that the neutrino self-interaction potential $H_{\nu\nu}$ to be comparable to or even larger than the matter potential in certain regions [^Flowers1976a]. It has been shown that the self-interaction between the neutrinos can cause the neutrino medium to oscillate collectively [^Duan2010] [^Duan2006]. The neutrino self-interaction also introduces a new characteristic energy scale which is proportional to the neutrino number density. As a result it is possible that neutrinos can oscillate on distance scales much shorter than the vacuum neutrino oscillation wavelength [^Sawyer2016] [^Chakraborty2016].

In this chapter, I will first review some of the general features of collective neutrino oscillations and introduce the method of linearized flavor stability analysis. I will then discuss the dispersion relations of the collective modes of neutrino oscillations and show that it may or may not be related to the flavor stability of a neutrino gas. Finally, I will demonstrate a preliminary study of a toy model which can be used to understand the neutrino oscillations in the presence of the neutrino halo [^Sarikas2012a] [^Cherry2012].
