    "abstract": "Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role for the explosion mechanism. First successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained with self-consistent, first-principle simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D). But 3D models tend to be less prone to explosion than corresponding axisymmetric (2D) ones. This has been explained by 3D turbulence leading to energy cascading from large to small spatial scales, inversely to the 2D case, thus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, it suggests that some important aspect may still be missing for robust and sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions. Such deficits could be associated with progenitor properties like rotation, magnetic fields or pre-collapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could lead to an enhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D, for example spiral modes of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time- and direction-dependent variations on the detectable neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of their consequences is still in its infancy.",

    "abstract": "We show that mass varying neutrinos (MaVaNs) can behave as a negative pressure fluid which could be the origin of the cosmic acceleration. We derive a model independent relation between the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the neutrino dark energy, which is applicable for general theories of mass varying particles. The neutrino mass depends on the local neutrino density and the observed neutrino mass can exceed the cosmological bound on a constant neutrino mass. We discuss microscopic realizations of the MaVaN acceleration scenario, which involve a sterile neutrino. We consider naturalness constraints for mass varying particles, and find that both ev cutoffs and ev mass particles are needed to avoid fine-tuning. These considerations give a (current) mass of order an eV for the sterile neutrino in microscopic realizations, which could be detectable at MiniBooNE. Because the sterile neutrino was much heavier at earlier times, constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis on additional states are not problematic. We consider regions of high neutrino density and find that the most likely place today to find neutrino masses which are significantly different from the neutrino masses in our solar system is in a supernova. The possibility of different neutrino mass in different regions of the galaxy and the local group could be significant for Z-burst models of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We also consider the cosmology of and the constraints on the “acceleron”, the scalar field which is responsible for the varying neutrino mass, and briefly discuss neutrino density dependent variations in other constants, such as the fine structure constant.",

    "abstract": "After a short survey of the physics of solar neutrinos, giving an overview of hydrogen burning reactions, predictions of standard solar models and results of solar neutrino experiments, we discuss the solar-model-independent indications in favour of non-standard neutrino properties. The experimental results look to be in contradiction with each other, even disregarding some experiment: unless electron neutrinos disappear in their trip from the sun to the earth, the fluxes of intermediate energy neutrinos (those from 7Be electron capture and from the CNO cycle) result to be unphysically negative, or anyway extremely reduced with respect to standard solar model predictions. Next we review extensively non-standard solar models built as attempts to solve the solar neutrino puzzle. The dependence of the central solar temperature on chemical composition, opacity, age and on the values of the astrophysical S-factors for hydrogen-burning reactions is carefully investigated. Also, possible modifications of the branching among the various pp-chains in view of nuclear physics uncertainties are examined. Assuming standard neutrinos, all solar models examined fail in reconciling theory with experiments, even when the physical and chemical inputs are radically changed with respect to present knowledge and even if some of the experimental results are discarded.",

    "abstract": "The MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect is the effect of transformation of one neutrino species (flavor) into another one in a medium with varying density. Three basic elements of the effect include: the refraction of neutrinos in matter, the resonance (level crossing) and the adiabaticity. The key notion is {$\\backslash$it the neutrino eigenstates} in matter. Physical picture of the effect is described in terms of the flavors and the relative phases of eigenstates and the transitions between eigenstates. Features of the large mixing realization of the MSW effect are discussed. The large mixing MSW effect (LMA) provides the solution of the solar neutrino problem. We show in details how this mechanism works. Physics beyond the LMA solution is discussed. The lower \\$Ar\\$-production rate (in comparison with the LMA prediction) and absence of significant \"turn up\" of the spectrum at low energies can be due to an additional effect of the light sterile neutrino with very small mixing.",

    "abstract": "We study the flavor-dependent neutrino spectra formation in the core of a supernova (SN) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A high-statistics neutrino signal from a galactic SN may contain information that severely constrains the parameter space for neutrino oscillations. Therefore, reliable predictions for flavor-dependent fluxes and spectra are urgently needed. In all traditional hydrodynamic simulations the nu\\_mu,tau and nu\\_mu,tau-bar interactions commonly included are rather schematic. With our Monte Carlo simulations we find that the most relevant sources for nu\\_mu,tau and nu\\_mu,tau-bar are traditionally not included. In comparing our numerical results for all flavors we find the standard hierarchy of mean energies nu\\_e \\< nu\\_e-bar \\< nu\\_mu,tau, with, however, very similar values for nu\\_mu,tau and nu\\_e-bar. The luminosities of nu\\_mu,tau and nu\\_mu,tau-bar can differ by up to a factor of 2 from L\\_nue-bar and L\\_nue, the latter two are very similar. The Garching Group obtains similar results from their self-consistent simulation with the full set of interactions. These results are almost orthogonal to the previous standard picture of exactly equal luminosities of all flavors and differences in mean energies of up to a factor of 2. Existing concepts for identifying oscillation effects in a SN neutrino signal need to be revised. We present two methods for detecting the earth-matter effect that are rather independent of predictions from SN simulations.",

    "abstract": "We study the flavor evolution of a dense gas initially consisting of pure mono-energetic \\$\\_e\\$ and \\$\\_e\\$. Using adiabatic invariants and the special symmetry in such a system we are able to calculate the flavor evolution of the neutrino gas for the cases with slowly decreasing neutrino number densities. These calculations give new insights into the results of recent large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor transformation in supernovae. For example, our calculations reveal the existence of what we term the “collective precession mode”. Our analyses suggest that neutrinos which travel on intersecting trajectories subject to destructive quantum interference nevertheless can be in this mode. This mode can result in sharp transitions in the final energy-dependent neutrino survival probabilities across all trajectories, a feature seen in the numerical simulations. Moreover, this transition is qualitatively different for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Exploiting this difference, the neutrino signals from a future galactic supernova can potentially be used to determine the actual neutrino mass hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "(Abridged) Neutrino heating may drive core-collapse supernova explosions. Although it is known that the stalled accretion shock turns into explosion when the neutrino luminosity from the collapsed core exceeds a critical value (L\\_crit) (the \"neutrino mechanism\"), the physics of L\\_crit, as well as its dependence on the properties of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and changes to the microphysics has never been systematically explored. We solve the one-dimensional steady-state accretion problem between the PNS surface and the accretion shock. We quantify the deep connection between the solution space of steady-state accretion flows with bounding shocks and the neutrino mechanism. We show that there is a maximum, critical sound speed above which it is impossible to maintain accretion with a standoff shock, because the shock jump conditions cannot be satisfied. The physics of this critical sound speed is general and does not depend on a specific heating mechanism. For the simple model of pressure-less free-fall onto a shock bounding an isothermal accretion flow with sound speed c\\_T, we show that if c\\_T\\^2/v\\_escape\\^2 \\> 3/16 explosion results. We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem, showing explicitly that the same physics determines L\\_crit. We find that the critical condition for explosion can be written as c\\_S\\^2/v\\_escape\\^2 = 0.19, where c\\_S is the adiabatic sound speed. This \"antesonic\" condition describes L\\_crit over a broad range in accretion rate and microphysics. We show that the addition of the accretion luminosity (L\\_acc) reduces L\\_crit non-trivially. As in previous work, we find that L\\_crit is always significantly higher than the maximum possible value of L\\_acc. Finally, we provide evidence that the reduction in L\\_crit seen in recent multi-dimensional simulations results from a reduction in the efficiency of cooling, rather than an increase in the heating rate.",

    "abstract": "Supernovae are the most powerful cosmic sources of MeV neutrinos. These elementary particles play a crucial role when the evolution of a massive star is terminated by the collapse of its core to a neutron star or a black hole and the star explodes as supernova. The release of electron neutrinos, which are abundantly produced by electron captures, accelerates the catastrophic infall and causes a gradual neutronization of the stellar plasma by converting protons to neutrons as dominant constituents of neutron star matter. The emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational binding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot initial to the cold final state. The absorption of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos in the surroundings of the newly formed neutron star can power the supernova explosion and determines the conditions in the innermost supernova ejecta, making them an interesting site for the nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements and trans-iron nuclei.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that the strong enhancement of the Earth (day-night) effect for solar neutrinos crossing the Earth core in the case of the small mixing angle MSW electron neutrino to muon (tau) neutrino transition solution of the solar neutrino problem is due to a new resonance effect in the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth and not just to the MSW effect in the core. The effect is in many respects similar to the electron paramagnetic resonance. The conditions for existence of this new resonance effect are discussed. They include specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation lengths in the Earth mantle and in the Earth core, thus the resonance is a “neutrino oscillation length resonance”. The effect exhibits strong dependence on the neutrino energy. Analytic expression for the probability accounting for the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth, which provides a high precision description of the transitions, including the new resonance effect, is derived. The implications of our results for the searches of the day-night asymmetry in the solar neutrino experiments are briefly discussed. The new resonance effect is operative also in the muon neutrino to electron neutrino (electron neutrino to muon neutrino) transitions of atmospheric neutrinos crossing the Earth core.",

    "abstract": "Review is devoted to the systematic representation of the theory (first part) and the applications (second part) of neutrino oscillations in matter. The evolution equations for mixed neutrinos in matter are deduced in different forms and analized. The consideration includes symmetries, limits of applications and some generalizations of equations. The analogies of the mixed neutrinos in matter have been found. We discuss in details the properties and the physical sense of the resonance in a system of mixed neutrinos. For homogeneous matter the effect of resonant enhancement of oscillations is described. Different representation of the adiabaticity condition, which determines a dynamics of neutrino oscillations, are given, and the adiabaticity parameter is introduced. Practically complete transformations of one neutrino species into another one are possible at the adiabatic (or near to adiabatic) crossing of resonance layer even at small vacuum mixing. The effect of non-oscillatory transition is remarked. Some results have been obtained for the adiabaticity violation regime. Also we review the exact solutions of the equations for special density distributions. The generalization of the theory for the case of three neutrino mixing is given. The effects of inelastic collisions as well as the divergence of neutrino wave packets are discussed. The theory of resonant conversion is applied then to the neutrino fluxes inside the Sun, the Earth and the collapsing stars. The distortion of the neutrino energy spectra by the matter filters with different density distributions are calculated. We describe the observable effects of conversion for solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as for neutrinos from collapsing stars. The searching for these effects is considered as a method of measuring the neutrino masses and mixing. Resonant conversion may quite naturally solve the solar neutrino problem. The distinctions of resonance conversion effects and another mechanisms for solar $\\nu$e - flux reduction are considered, and in this connection the possibilities of solar neutrino spectroscopy are outlined. We discuss the consequences of $\\nu$ - signal detection from supernova 1987A. 1989.",

    "abstract": "We study the flavor evolution of a dense gas initially consisting of pure mono-energetic \\$\\_e\\$ and \\$\\_e\\$. Using adiabatic invariants and the special symmetry in such a system we are able to calculate the flavor evolution of the neutrino gas for the cases with slowly decreasing neutrino number densities. These calculations give new insights into the results of recent large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor transformation in supernovae. For example, our calculations reveal the existence of what we term the “collective precession mode”. Our analyses suggest that neutrinos which travel on intersecting trajectories subject to destructive quantum interference nevertheless can be in this mode. This mode can result in sharp transitions in the final energy-dependent neutrino survival probabilities across all trajectories, a feature seen in the numerical simulations. Moreover, this transition is qualitatively different for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Exploiting this difference, the neutrino signals from a future galactic supernova can potentially be used to determine the actual neutrino mass hierarchy.",

The KamLAND experiment is not expected to determine ??m???2 if the latter happens to lie in the indicated region. By analysing both the total event rate suppression and the energy spectrum distortion caused by v??e oscillations in vacuum, we show that the optimal baseline of such an experiment is L ??? (20-25) km. Furthermore, for 10-4 eV2 \\< ??m???2 ??? 5 ?? 10-4 eV2, the same experiment might be used to try to distinguish between the two possible types of neutrino mass spectrum - with normal or with inverted hierarchy, by exploring the effect of interference between the atmospheric- and solar-??m2 driven oscillations; for larger values of ??m???2 not exceeding 8.0 ?? 10-4 eV2, a shorter baseline, L ??? 10 km, would be needed for the purpose. The indicated interference effect modifies in a characteristic way the energy spectrum of detected events. Distinguishing between the two types of neutrino mass spectrum requires, however, a high precision determination of the atmospheric ??m2, a sufficiently large sin2 ?? and a non-maximal sin2 2?????, where ?? and ????? are the mixing angles, respectively, limited by the CHOOZ and Palo Verde data and characterizing the solar neutrino oscillations.

    "abstract": "During the shock-wave propagation in a core-collapse supernova (SN), matter turbulence may affect neutrino flavor conversion probabilities. Such effects have been usually studied by adding small-scale random fluctuations (with arbitrary amplitude) on top of coarse, spherically symmetric matter density profiles. Recently, however, two-dimensional (2D) SN models have reached a space resolution high enough to directly trace anisotropic density profiles, down to scales smaller than the typical neutrino oscillation length. In this context, we analyze the statistical properties of a large set of SN matter density profiles obtained in a high-resolution 2D simulation, focusing on a post-bounce time (2 s) suited to study shock-wave effects on neutrino propagation on scales as small as 15 km. We clearly find the imprint of a broken (Kolmogorov-Kraichnan) power-law structure, as generically expected in 2D turbulence spectra. We then compute the flavor evolution of SN neutrinos along representative realizations of the turbulent matter density profiles, and observe no significant damping of the neutrino crossing probabilities on their way through the shock wave, contrary to previous findings in the literature. We surmise that the lack of damping is likely to apply also to 3D conditions to be studied by future 3D simulations with comparable resolution. These results show the importance of anchoring turbulence effects on SN neutrinos to realistic, fine-grained SN models.",

    "abstract": "Multidimensional core-collapse supernova simulations exhibit turbulence of large amplitude and over large scales. As neutrinos pass through the supernova mantle the turbulence is expected to modify their evolution compared to the case where the explosion is free of turbulence. In this paper we study this turbulence effect upon the neutrinos modeling the turbulence expected from multidimensional simulations by adding matter density fluctuations to density profiles taken from one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We investigate the impact upon the supernova neutrino transition probabilities as a function of the neutrino mixing angle $\\theta$13 and turbulence amplitude. In the high resonant channel and with large $\\theta$13 values we find that turbulence is effectively two flavor for fluctuation amplitudes 1% and have identified a new effect due to the combination of turbulence and multiple high resonances that leads to a sensitivity to fluctuations amplitudes as small as ∼0.001%. At small values of $\\theta$13, beyond the range achievable in Earth based experiments, we find that turbulence leads to new flavor transient effects in the channel where the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein high resonance occurs. Finally, we investigate large amplitude fluctuations which lead to three-flavor effects due to broken high-low factorization and significant nonresonant transitions and identify two nonresonant turbulence effects, one depending on the $\\theta$13, and the other independent of this angle and due to the low Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance. 2010 The American Physical Society.",

The criteria under which physical fluctuations can be well approximated by the delta-correlated gaussian noise for the above cases are examined. Current limits on the possible neutrino magnetic moment and solar magnetic field suggest that a reasonably noisy solar magnetic field would not appreciably affect the solar electron neutrino flux.

Our calculations are the first to allow explicit flavor evolution histories on different neutrino trajectories and to self-consistently couple flavor development on these trajectories through forward scattering-induced quantum entanglement. Employing the atmospheric-scale neutrino mass-squared difference and values of theta\\_13 allowed by current bounds, we find transformation of neutrino and antineutrino flavors over broad ranges of energy and luminosity in roughly the “bi-polar” collective mode. We find that this large-scale flavor conversion, largely driven by the flavor off-diagonal neutrino-neutrino forward scattering potential, sets in much closer to the proto-neutron star than simple estimates based on flavor-diagonal potentials and Mikeheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein evolution would indicate. In turn, this suggests that models of r-process nucleosynthesis sited in the neutrino-driven wind could be affected substantially by active-active neutrino flavor mixing, even with the small measured neutrino mass-squared differences.",

Here we further investigate the underlying physics of MNR type flavor transitions. We provide generalized resonance conditions and make analytical predictions for the behavior of the system. We discuss the adiabatic evolution of these transitions, considering both Symmetric and Standard scenarios. Symmetric MNR transitions differ from Standard MNR transitions in that both neutrinos and antineutrinos can completely transform to other flavors simultaneously. We provide an example of the simplest system in which such transitions can occur with a neutrino and an antineutrino having a single energy and emission angle. We further apply linearized stability analysis to predict the location of self-induced nutation type (or bipolar) oscillations due to neutrino-neutrino interactions in the regions where MNR is ineffective. In all cases, we compare our analytical predictions to numerical calculations.",

We show that neutrino flavor transformation through MNRs can be explained by multiple adiabatic solutions similar to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein mechanism.

    "abstract": "The most general case of self-induced neutrino flavor evolution is described by a set of kinetic equations for a dense neutrino gas evolving both in space and time. Solutions of these equations have been typically worked out assuming that either the time (in the core-collapse supernova environment) or space (in the early universe) homogeneity in the initial conditions is preserved through the evolution. In these cases one can gauge away the homogeneous variable and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. In this paper we investigate if small deviations from an initial postulated homogeneity can be amplified by the interacting neutrino gas, leading to a new flavor instability. To this end, we consider a simple two flavor isotropic neutrino gas evolving in time, and initially composed by only \\$\\_e\\$ and \\$\\_e\\$ with equal densities. In the homogeneous case, this system shows a bimodal instability in the inverted mass hierarchy scheme, leading to the well studied flavor pendulum behavior. This would lead to periodic pair conversions \\$\\_e \\_e \\_x \\_x\\$. To break space homogeneity, we introduce small amplitude space-dependent perturbations in the matter potential. By Fourier transforming the equations of motion with respect to the space coordinate, we then numerically solve a set of coupled equations for the different Fourier modes. We find that even for arbitrarily tiny inhomogeneities, the system evolution runs away from the stable pendulum behavior: the different modes are excited and the space-averaged ensemble evolves towards flavor equilibrium. We finally comment on the role of a time decaying neutrino background density in weakening these results.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the relationship between a symmetry in the neutrino flavour evolution equations and neutrino flavour oscillations in the collective precession mode. This collective precession mode can give rise to spectral swaps (splits) when conditions can be approximated as homogeneous and isotropic. Multi-angle numerical simulations of supernova neutrino flavour transformation show that when this approximation breaks down, non-collective neutrino oscillation modes decohere kinematically, but the collective precession mode still is expected to stand out. We provide a criterion for significant flavour transformation to occur if neutrinos participate in a collective precession mode. This criterion can be used to understand the suppression of collective neutrino oscillations in anisotropic environments in the presence of a high matter density. This criterion is also useful in understanding the breakdown of the collective precession mode when neutrino densities are small.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino-neutrino interactions in dense neutrino streams, like those emitted by a core-collapse supernova, can lead to self-induced neutrino flavor conversions. While this is a nonlinear phenomenon, the onset of these conversions can be examined through a standard stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion. The problem is reduced to a linear eigenvalue equation that involves the neutrino density, energy spectrum, angular distribution, and matter density. In the single-angle case, we reproduce previous results and use them to identify two generic instabilities: The system is stable above a cutoff density (\"cutoff mode\"), or can approach an asymptotic instability for increasing density (\"saturation mode\"). We analyze multi-angle effects on these generic types of instabilities and find that even the saturation mode is suppressed at large densities. For both types of modes, a given multi-angle spectrum typically is unstable when the neutrino and electron densities are comparable, but stable when the neutrino density is much smaller or much larger than the electron density. The role of an instability in the SN context depends on the available growth time and on the range of affected modes. At large matter density, most modes are off-resonance even when the system is unstable.",

Taking into account differences in these distributions that must be present, as a result of the species-dependent scattering cross-sections lower down in the star, leads to a new set of non-linear equations. These equations are unstable, even at the initial surface, with respect to perturbations that have both tiny mixing from neutrino oscillations and that break all-over spherical-symmetry.

Our exposition centers on three collective neutrino oscillation scenarios: a simple bipolar neutrino system that initially consists of mono-energetic electron neutrinos and antineutrinos; a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas with multiple neutrino/antineutrino species and continuous energy spectra; and a generic neutrino gas in an anisotropic environment. We use each of these scenarios to illustrate key facets of collective neutrino oscillations.

    "abstract": "Neutrino-neutrino refraction in dense media can cause self-induced flavor conversion triggered by collective run-away modes of the interacting flavor oscillators. The growth rates were usually found to be of order a typical vacuum oscillation frequency \\$m\\^2/2E\\$. However, even in the simple case of a \\$\\_e\\$ beam interacting with an opposite-moving \\$\\_e\\$ beam, and allowing for spatial inhomogeneities, the growth rate of the fastest-growing Fourier mode is of order \\$={2} G\\_{F} n\\_{, a typical \\$\\$–\\$\\$ interaction energy. This growth rate is much larger than the vacuum oscillation frequency and gives rise to flavor conversion on a much shorter time scale. This phenomenon of \"fast flavor conversion\" occurs even for vanishing \\$m\\^2/2E\\$ and thus does not depend on energy, but only on the angle distributions. Moreover, it does not require neutrinos to mix or to have masses, except perhaps for providing seed disturbances. We also construct a simple homogeneous example consisting of intersecting beams and study a schematic supernova model proposed by Ray Sawyer, where \\$\\_e\\$ and \\$\\_e\\$ emerge with different zenith-angle distributions, the key ingredient for fast flavor conversion. What happens in realistic astrophysical scenarios remains to be understood.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently pointed out that neutrino fluxes from a supernova can show substantial flavor conversions almost immediately above the core. Using linear stability analyses and numerical solutions of the fully nonlinear equations of motion, we perform a detailed study of these fast conversions, focussing on the region just above the supernova core. We carefully specify the instabilities for evolution in space or time, andfind that neutrinos travelling towards the core make fast conversions more generic, i.e., possible for a wider range of flux ratios and angular asymmetries that produce a crossing between the zenith-angle spectra of \\$\\_e\\$ and \\${\\_e}\\$. Using fluxes and angular distributions predicted by supernova simulations, we find that fast conversions can occur within tens of nanoseconds, only a few meters away from the putative neutrinospheres. If these fast flavor conversions indeed take place, they would have important implications for the supernova explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis.",

Such a system occurs in the early Universe if neutrinos have a non-zero chemical potential. Solutions to the equations lead to a new type of coherent behavior governed by two modes. These bimodal solutions provide new insights into dense neutrino gases and into neutrino oscillations in the early Universe, thereby allowing one to surmise the flavor behavior of neutrinos with a non-zero chemical potential.",

    "abstract": "Supernova neutrinos can exhibit a rich variety of flavor conversion mechanisms. In particular, they can experience \"fast\" self-induced flavor conversions almost immediately above the core. Very recently, a novel method has been proposed to investigate these phenomena, in terms of the dispersion relation for the complex frequency and wave number (\\$\\$,\\$k\\$) of disturbances in the mean field of the \\$\\_e\\_x\\$ flavor coherence. We discuss a systematic approach to such instabilities, originally developed in the context of plasma physics, and based of the time-asymptotic behavior of the Green’s function of the system. Instabilities are typically seen to emerge for complex \\$\\$, and can be further characterized as convective (moving away faster than they spread) and absolute (growing locally), depending on \\$k\\$-dependent features. Stable cases emerge when \\$k\\$ (but not \\$\\$) is complex, leading to disturbances damped in space, or when both \\$\\$ and \\$k\\$ are real, corresponding to complete stability. The analytical classification of both unstable and stable modes leads not only to qualitative insights about their features but also to quantitative predictions about the growth rates of instabilities. Representative numerical solutions are discussed in a simple two-beam model of interacting neutrinos. As an application, we argue that supernova and binary neutron star mergers exhibiting a \"crossing\" in the electron lepton number would lead to an absolute instability in the flavor content of the neutrino gas.",

    "abstract": "In the early universe or in some regions of supernovae, the neutrino refractive index is dominated by the neutrinos themselves. Several previous studies have found numerically that these self-interactions have the effect of coupling different neutrino modes in such a way as to synchronize the flavor oscillations which otherwise would depend on the energy of a given mode. We provide a simple explanation for this baffling phenomenon in analogy to a system of magnetic dipoles which are coupled by their self-interactions to form one large magnetic dipole which then precesses coherently in a weak external magnetic field. In this picture the synchronized neutrino oscillations are perfectly analogous to the weak-field Zeeman effect in atoms.",

    "abstract": "We identify a generic new form of collective flavor oscillations in dense neutrino gases that amounts to a self-induced parametric resonance. It occurs in a homogeneous and isotropic ensemble when a range of neutrino modes is prepared in a different flavor than the neighboring modes with lower and higher energies. The flavor content of the intermediate spectral part librates relative to the other parts with a frequency corresponding to a typical Delta m\\^2/2E. This libration persists in the limit of an arbitrarily large neutrino density where one would have expected synchronized flavor oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino-neutrino interactions can lead to collective flavour conversion effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We demonstrate that the case of \"bipolar\" oscillations, where a dense gas of neutrinos and antineutrinos in equal numbers completely converts from one flavour to another even if the mixing angle is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour space. Bipolar flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging of the pendulum, which begins in an unstable upright position (the initial flavour), and passes through momentarily the vertically downward position (the other flavour) in the course of its motion. The time scale to complete one cycle of oscillation depends logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle. Likewise, the presence of an ordinary medium can be shown analytically to contribute to a logarithmic increase in the bipolar conversion period. We further find that a more complex (and realistic) system of unequal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos is analogous to a spinning top subject to a torque. This analogy easily explains how such a system can oscillate in both the bipolar and the synchronised mode, depending on the neutrino density and the size of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. Our simple model applies strictly only to isotropic neutrino gasses. In more general cases, and especially for neutrinos streaming from a supernova core, different modes couple to each other with unequal strength, an effect that can lead to kinematical decoherence in flavour space rather than collective oscillations. The exact circumstances under which collective oscillations occur in non-isotropic media remain to be understood.",
